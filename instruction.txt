First, my team can not provides an executable file. Because model uses a lag 12 days up to now for each prediction. So if committee take only a single row of test data on the command line, my model can not work and give prediction. Please give test data structure like test dataset (use to score and submit).

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, keras.

Model: recurrent neural network (LSTM)

Instruction:
1. Please add to folder "data" train and test file csv.
2. Run file "model-LSTM-final.ipynb"
3. Get file "submit_final.csv" at folder "result"
